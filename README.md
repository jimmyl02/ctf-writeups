# ctf-writeups
All of my solve scripts for CTF challenges I have solved.

On my blog at [blog.jimmyli.us](http://blog.jimmyli.us) you can find detailed writeups for some of the challenges I have solved. However, there are some problems that I have solved which I won't writeup and I will leave the solve scripts here.

Note: For the web challenges which require something to visit my website it is important to not have https / http mixing so I will change the server config to match.
